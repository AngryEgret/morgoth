# Morgoth

Welcome to the Morgoth documentation. This site is a working document.
Basic tutorials and examples have been documented but there is still more to do.

## State of Morgoth
Currently Morgoth is pre-production. InfluxDB 0.9.x has been released and Morgoth has been updated to work with the new API.
The first release of Morgoth v0.1 is scheduled for the end of August 2015.
The v0.1 release will be functional for a basic use cases but it will lack significant performance testing.
