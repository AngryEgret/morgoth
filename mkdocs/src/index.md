# Morgoth

Welcome to the Morgoth documentation. This site is a working document.
Basic tutotials and examples have been documented but there is still more to do.

## State of Morgoth
Currently Morgoth is pre-production. I (the author) have a Morgoth instance running along side
a production metrics stream in a non-critical path. A single 4 core machine running Morgoth backed by a
single 4 core InfluxDB instance easily handles several thousand metrics. There are many factors that
contribute to load and I do not have solid performance metrics at this time.
