# Fingerprints

A `Fingerprint` is a summary data structure of a given window of data.
For example the `Sigma` fingerprinter stores only the count, mean, and standard deviation of the window.
Fingerprints can be compared to other fingperprints to determine if they are a 'match'.

The [detection framework](/concepts/detection_framework) explains how fingperprints are used to detect anomalies.
