{"name":"Morgoth","tagline":"Metrics collection and analytics","body":"\r\nMorgoth\r\n=======\r\n\r\nMorgoth is a metric collection system with two main focuses:\r\n\r\n1. Detect anomalies in the data in real time.\r\n2. Allow storage of arbitrary metrics with little overhead.\r\n\r\nIt is built on top of MongoDB.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetect Anomalies in Real Time\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nMorgoth is watching the metrics in real time. It will provide notification of\r\nany anomalies in the metrics given to it.\r\n\r\nStore Arbitrary Metrics\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nMorgoth stores only the data points it is given. This provides two key\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nFirst an application can log metrics of dynamic aspects. This way\r\nanomalies on per user or per client can be detected.\r\n\r\nSecond the application can aggresively log a metric and then decide later how\r\nimportant the metric is.\r\n\r\nTODO: Implement aggregation so metrics can be reduced in size at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnomaly Detection\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSince morgoth is primarily focused on anomaly detection we should explain\r\nits methods...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
